Transmitting screen content, mouse and keyboard data to read Windows Events or restart a service? This is so 2014! Royal Server is a secure gateway (SSH tunnel) and provides common remote management tasks to our cross-platform clients (Windows, OS X and soon iOS and Android) using their native UI. The combination of Royal Server and the award winning Royal TS/X remote management clients takes remote systems management to a whole new level.
