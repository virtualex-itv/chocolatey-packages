# [DEPRECATED] openlens

## This package has been deprecated

OpenLens has been deprecated because the project is **discontinued**.

In early 2024, Mirantis removed the public source code for Lens, making it impossible to build new OpenLens releases. The last OpenLens release (v6.5.2-366) was in June 2023.

## Replacement

Use **[freelens](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/freelens)** instead.

[Freelens](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens) is an active open-source fork created by community contributors to continue the OpenLens vision with modern Kubernetes support and long-term maintenance.

To install Freelens:

```powershell
choco install freelens
```

## What happens when you install this package?

This deprecated package depends on `freelens`. When you install or update the `openlens` package, Freelens will be installed automatically as a replacement.
