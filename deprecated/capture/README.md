# [DEPRECATED] capture

## ⚠️ This package has been deprecated

TechSmith Capture (formerly known as Jing) has been officially retired by TechSmith Corporation and is no longer supported or available for download from the official website.

## Replacement

TechSmith recommends **[Snagit](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/snagit)** as the replacement for Capture/Jing.

To install Snagit:

```powershell
choco install snagit
```

## What happened to this package?

This package now depends on `snagit`. When you update the `capture` package, Snagit will be installed automatically as a replacement.
