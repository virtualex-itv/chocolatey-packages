<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>[DEPRECATED] TechSmith Capture (Formerly Jing) has been discontinued. Please use Snagit instead.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[## DEPRECATED - This package is no longer maintained

TechSmith Capture (formerly known as Jing) has been officially retired by TechSmith Corporation and is no longer supported or available for download from the official website.

### Replacement Product

TechSmith recommends **Snagit** as the replacement for Capture/Jing. Snagit includes all the features of Capture plus many more:
- Advanced screenshot and screen recording capabilities
- Scrolling capture
- Advanced annotation tools
- Video recording with audio
- Organized library for managing captures

### Migration

This deprecated package now depends on the `snagit` package. When you update this package, Snagit will be installed automatically as a replacement.

To manually install Snagit, run:
```
choco install snagit
```
