# VMware Workstation Player - DEPRECATED

VMware Workstation Player was **discontinued in May 2024** when VMware Workstation Pro became free for personal use.

As of November 2024, VMware Workstation Pro is **free for all users** (commercial, educational, and personal) and no longer requires a license key.

## Why was Player discontinued?

VMware Workstation Player was a stripped-down version of Workstation Pro. Since Workstation Pro is now free with no functional limitations, there is no longer a need for a separate Player product.

## What happens when you install this package?

This deprecated package depends on **[vmwareworkstation](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vmwareworkstation)**, the VMware Workstation Pro package.

**Note:** The vmwareworkstation package has been retired because Broadcom now requires account authentication to download VMware Workstation Pro. See that package for alternatives.

## Alternatives

- **VMware Workstation Pro** - Download directly from [Broadcom](https://support.broadcom.com) (free, requires account)
- **VirtualBox** - Free and open source: `choco install virtualbox`
- **Hyper-V** - Built into Windows Pro/Enterprise
