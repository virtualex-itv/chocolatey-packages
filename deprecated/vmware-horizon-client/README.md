# [DEPRECATED] vmware-horizon-client

## This package has been deprecated

VMware Horizon Client has been deprecated and rebranded to **Omnissa Horizon Client**.

In 2024, Broadcom sold VMware's End-User Computing (EUC) division to KKR, which rebranded it as Omnissa. The Horizon Client is now developed and distributed by Omnissa.

## Replacement

Use **[omnissa-horizon-client](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/omnissa-horizon-client)** instead.

To install Omnissa Horizon Client:

```powershell
choco install omnissa-horizon-client
```

## What happens when you install this package?

This deprecated package depends on `omnissa-horizon-client`. When you install or update the `vmware-horizon-client` package, Omnissa Horizon Client will be installed automatically as a replacement.
