## DEPRECATED - This package is no longer maintained

TechSmith Capture (formerly known as Jing) has been officially retired by TechSmith Corporation and is no longer supported or available for download from the official website.

- Organized library for managing captures

### Migration

This deprecated package now depends on the `snagit` package. When you update this package, Snagit will be installed automatically as a replacement.
