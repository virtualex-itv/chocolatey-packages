# [DEPRECATED] Capture (Formerly Jing)

## ⚠️ This package has been deprecated

TechSmith Capture (formerly known as Jing) has been officially retired by TechSmith Corporation and is no longer supported or available for download from the official website.

## Replacement

TechSmith recommends **[Snagit](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/snagit)** as the replacement for Capture/Jing.

### Install Snagit

To install Snagit, run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

```powershell
choco install snagit
```

## What Happened?

The `capture` package now depends on `snagit`. When you update the `capture` package, Snagit will be installed automatically as a replacement.

Snagit includes all the features of Capture plus many more:

- Advanced screenshot and screen recording capabilities
- Scrolling capture
- Advanced annotation tools
- Video recording with audio
- Organized library for managing captures
