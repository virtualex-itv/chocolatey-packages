## Description

## DEPRECATED

VMware Horizon Client has been deprecated and rebranded to **Omnissa Horizon Client**.

In 2024, Broadcom sold VMware's End-User Computing (EUC) division to KKR, which rebranded it as Omnissa. The Horizon Client is now developed and distributed by Omnissa.

### What happens when you install this package?

This deprecated package will automatically install the replacement package **[omnissa-horizon-client](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/omnissa-horizon-client)** as a dependency.

---

### Migration

To migrate manually:
```powershell
choco uninstall vmware-horizon-client
choco install omnissa-horizon-client
```

Or simply update, and the dependency will handle the transition:
```powershell
choco upgrade vmware-horizon-client
```
