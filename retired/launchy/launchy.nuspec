    <summary>RETIRED: Launchy development has stalled and source code was removed. This package can no longer be maintained.</summary>
    <description>## This package has been retired.

Launchy was a free cross-platform keystroke launcher utility that helped users launch programs, documents, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes.

### Why was this package retired?

- Development stalled since June 2023
- Source code was removed by maintainers from GitHub (Open-Launcher/launchy)
- The project appears abandoned with no active development
- No new releases or maintenance updates are expected

### Alternatives

- **PowerToys Run** (`powertoys`) - Microsoft's built-in launcher (Windows 10/11)
- **Keypirinha** - Fast keystroke launcher for Windows
- **Listary** - File search and app launcher
- **Wox** - Full-featured launcher with plugin support
