# VMware Workstation Pro - RETIRED

This package has been retired because VMware Workstation Pro downloads now require authentication through the Broadcom support portal, making automated package updates impossible.

## Good news: VMware Workstation Pro is now FREE

As of November 2024, VMware Workstation Pro is **free for all users** (commercial, educational, and personal) and no longer requires a license key.

## How to get VMware Workstation Pro

VMware Workstation Pro must now be downloaded directly from Broadcom, which requires creating a free Broadcom account:

1. Create a free account at [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com)
2. Navigate to VMware Desktop Hypervisor downloads
3. Download VMware Workstation Pro

## Why this package cannot be maintained

Following Broadcom's acquisition of VMware, the direct download URLs were removed from public CDNs. Downloads now require authentication through the Broadcom support portal, making automated package updates impossible.

## Alternatives

- **VMware Workstation Pro** - Download directly from [Broadcom](https://support.broadcom.com) (free, requires account)
- **VirtualBox** - Free and open source: `choco install virtualbox`
- **Hyper-V** - Built into Windows Pro/Enterprise
