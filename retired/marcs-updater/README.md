## This package has been retired

This package has been retired because Marcs Updater is no longer actively developed and better alternatives are available.

### What is Marcs Updater?

Marcs Updater is a dynamic DNS client for Windows that automatically sends IP changes to your dynamic DNS account. It supports multiple providers including DNS-O-Matic, DynDNS, No-IP, and OpenDNS.

The software is still available for download at [marc.hoersken.de/updater](https://marc.hoersken.de/updater) but is no longer being maintained.

### Alternatives

If you need a dynamic DNS client, consider:

- Your router's built-in DDNS support
- [ddclient](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ddclient) (open source)
- Your DNS provider's own update client
