## This package has been retired

Start8 was a Windows 8 Start menu replacement tool by Stardock. **Windows 8 reached end of support on January 10, 2023**, and the software is no longer relevant for modern Windows systems.

### Why was this package retired?

- Windows 8 has reached end of life and is no longer supported by Microsoft
- Start8 was designed to restore the Windows 7 Start menu on Windows 8, which is not applicable to Windows 10/11
- The software has no practical use on modern operating systems

### Alternatives

For Start menu customization on modern Windows, consider:

- **Start11** - Modern Start menu customization: `choco install start11`
- **StartAllBack** - Windows 11 Start menu alternative: available on Chocolatey Community Repository
