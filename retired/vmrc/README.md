# VMware Remote Console - RETIRED

This package has been retired because VMware Remote Console (VMRC) downloads now require authentication through the Broadcom support portal, making automated package updates impossible.

## VMware Remote Console is still available

VMRC is a free product that does not require a license key. However, downloads now require a Broadcom account.

**Version availability:**
- **VMRC 11.x - 12.x**: Available with standard vSphere license (works with vSphere 7.x and 8.x)
- **VMRC 13.x**: Requires VMware Cloud Foundation or vSphere Foundation entitlement (works with vSphere/VCF 9)

## How to get VMware Remote Console

1. Create a free account at [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com)
2. Navigate to My Downloads and search for vSphere
3. Select the Drivers & Tools tab
4. Expand the version and download VMRC

For macOS users, VMRC can be installed directly from the App Store.

## Why this package cannot be maintained

Following Broadcom's acquisition of VMware, the direct download URLs were removed from public CDNs. Downloads now require authentication through the Broadcom support portal, making automated package updates impossible.
