# ModernMix - RETIRED

ModernMix was a Stardock utility that allowed running Windows 8 "Modern Apps" (Metro apps) in resizable windows on the desktop. **The Windows 8 Modern App ecosystem no longer exists in Windows 10/11**, making this software obsolete.

## Why was this package retired?

- Windows 8 Modern Apps (Metro apps) were replaced by UWP apps in Windows 10
- The specific problem ModernMix solved (running full-screen Modern Apps in windows) no longer applies
- Windows 10/11 already run UWP apps in resizable windows by default
- The software has no practical use on modern operating systems

## What happens when you install this package?

This retired package displays a warning message informing users that ModernMix is no longer relevant.

## Note

There is no direct replacement for ModernMix because the problem it solved no longer exists in modern Windows.
